Once at that page, download the .zip file there. Your username
is <b>'instructor'</b>, your password is 'myClass' (<b>case sensitive</b>). 
To download a file, right-click on the file name, and choose 
<i>Save Link As...</i>, or similar instruction (browser-dependent).

As the three tables inside the zip file contain personally
identifiable information, it is encrypted. The staff person
who prepared this report for you will provide the password
you will need when trying to unzip the file.

Once inside, the main table file will include 'EventXtract' in its name. Each
of its rows contains one 'event,' a student's interaction with
the OpenEdX learning platform. The table file that includes the term
'VideoInteraction' excerpts rows from the EventXtract table 
that are video related. This table is convenient for when you are
particularly interested in video.

Rows in the table file that contains the name 'ActivityGrade' excerpts 
all the assignment related rows from EventXtract, but adds additional
assignment related information.
